\chapter*{Preface}

% Some people like to put in a little quote (Knuth in particular loves this)

\begin{quote}
\noindent\textit{Men occasionally stumble over the truth, but most of them pick themselves up and
hurry off as if nothing had happened.}

\hspace{2cm}--- Winston Churchill
\end{quote}

Much of the front matter is optional. In particular, include things like a Dedication, List of Figures, List of Tables, List of Algorithms, only if there are enough of them to justify it and it would help the reader.

Don't include both a Foreword and a Preface since they perform similar roles.

The same goes for appendices, index, glossary, list of notation and terms at the end. Include if they would help the reader.

But always, of course, include the Bibliography.
